fix: Restore risk analysis data to Ankara GeoJSON and add deployment config

CRITICAL FIX: Ankara GeoJSON was missing all risk analysis data after cleaning
in QGIS. This caused the map to display empty/gray neighborhoods with no risk
scores, demographics, or seismic data.

## Changes Made

### Data Fix (Critical)
- Fixed public/data/ankara_mahalle_risk.geojson by rejoining risk data from CSV
- Properties increased from 29 (OSM only) to 58 (full risk analysis)
- All 786 Ankara neighborhoods now have complete risk, VS30, PGA, and demographic data
- Created backup: ankara_mahalle_risk_backup.geojson

### Deployment Configuration
- Added vercel.json for proper routing (/, /dashboard, /dashboard.html)
- Updated .gitignore to protect environment variables
- Ensured both React app and dashboard routes work correctly

### Code Improvements
- Enhanced App.jsx data loading with timeout handling (12s limit)
- Added Promise.allSettled for robust parallel GeoJSON loading
- Improved code formatting and readability

### Documentation
- Created QUICK_START.md - Deploy in 3 steps
- Created DEPLOYMENT.md - Full deployment guide with troubleshooting
- Created FIXES_APPLIED.md - Detailed summary of all fixes
- Updated README.md - Complete project documentation

### Utilities
- Added scripts/fix-ankara-geojson.js - Data repair script
- Added scripts/verify-deployment.js - Pre-deployment verification

## Verification

Run before deploy:
  node scripts/verify-deployment.js

Expected: ✅ 6 checks passed, 0 errors

## Data Status
- Istanbul: 955 features, 67 properties ✅
- Ankara: 786 features, 58 properties ✅ (FIXED)

## Next Steps
1. Add VITE_MAPTILER_KEY to Vercel environment variables
2. Push to trigger auto-deployment
3. Verify both / and /dashboard routes work

Fixes: Site not working due to missing Ankara risk data
