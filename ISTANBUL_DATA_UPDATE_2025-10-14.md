# Istanbul Data Update - October 14, 2025

## 🎯 Summary

The Istanbul risk map webapp has been successfully updated with **corrected neighborhood coordinates** and **enhanced features**. All 956 Istanbul neighborhoods now display in their correct geographic locations with complete risk data and earthquake scenario information.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Coordinate Accuracy (CRITICAL FIX)**
- **Problem**: Old `istanbul_mahalle_risk.geojson` had 955 features with **incorrect coordinates** (many duplicates, wrong locations)
- **Solution**: Replaced with `istanbul_mahalle_956_webapp_CORRECTED.geojson`
- **Result**: All 956 unique neighborhoods now have **100% accurate coordinates** calculated from correct geometries

**Evidence**:
```
OLD DATA: 955 features, 762 unique mah_id (many duplicates)
NEW DATA: 956 features, 956 unique mah_id (perfect 1:1 mapping)
```

### 2. **Population & Building Count Visualization (BUG FIX)**
- **Problem**: Population and building count metrics weren't coloring the map polygons
- **Root Cause**: Metric selector used English field names (`population`, `building_count`) but GeoJSON has Turkish names (`toplam_nufus`, `toplam_bina`)
- **Solution**:
  - Updated metric options to use correct Turkish field names
  - Added color ramps for Turkish field names
  - Both old and new field names now supported

### 3. **Earthquake Scenario Display (NEW FEATURE)**
- **Added Metrics**:
  - ✅ PGA Scenario MW 7.2 - Peak ground acceleration for 7.2 magnitude earthquake
  - ✅ PGA Scenario MW 7.5 - Peak ground acceleration for 7.5 magnitude earthquake
  - ✅ ML Risk Score - Machine learning predicted risk score
  - ✅ ML Predicted Class - ML classification (1-5 scale)

- **Enhanced Popup**: Now shows:
  - Basic info (neighborhood, district, city)
  - Population & building count
  - **EARTHQUAKE SCENARIOS** section (if available)
    - PGA MW 7.2 value (in g)
    - PGA MW 7.5 value (in g)
  - **ML PREDICTION** section (if available)
    - ML Risk Score
    - Predicted Risk Class

### 4. **Color Ramps for All Metrics**
Added professional color schemes for new metrics:
- **PGA Scenarios**: Yellow → Amber → Orange → Red (earthquake intensity)
- **ML Risk Score**: Green → Yellow → Orange → Red (risk gradient)
- **ML Predicted Class**: Green (low) → Red (high) discrete colors

## 📊 Data Quality Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total Features | 955 | 956 |
| Unique mah_id | 762 | 956 |
| Coordinate Accuracy | ❌ Wrong | ✅ 100% Correct |
| Coverage | 99.9% | 100% |
| Scenario Data | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present |
| ML Predictions | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present |

3. **Population** - Total neighborhood population (now working!)
4. **Building Count** - Total building count (now working!)
5. **PGA Scenario MW 7.2** - Earthquake scenario 7.2 magnitude (NEW)
6. **PGA Scenario MW 7.5** - Earthquake scenario 7.5 magnitude (NEW)
7. **ML Risk Score** - Machine learning risk prediction (NEW)

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Interactive Popup Enhancements
When clicking on a neighborhood, users now see:

**Before**:
```
[Neighborhood Name]
District • City
Risk: High
Population: 45,230
Buildings: 1,234
[Select] [Zoom]
```

**After**:
```
[Neighborhood Name]
District • City
Risk: High
Population: 45,230
Buildings: 1,234

─────────────────────
EARTHQUAKE SCENARIOS
PGA MW 7.2: 0.234g
PGA MW 7.5: 0.312g

─────────────────────
ML PREDICTION
ML Risk Score: 3.45
Predicted Class: 4

## 🔍 Verification Steps Completed

✅ Verified 956 unique mah_id in new data
✅ Verified all coordinates are correct (match source geometries)
✅ Verified scenario columns present in data
✅ Verified ML prediction columns present in data
✅ Tested build process (successful)
✅ Verified dist folder updated with correct data
✅ Verified color ramps working for all metrics
✅ No console errors during build

## 📝 Technical Details

### Coordinate Calculation Method
All coordinates were recalculated using **geometry centroid method**:
```python
gdf['centroid_lon'] = gdf.geometry.centroid.x
gdf['centroid_lat'] = gdf.geometry.centroid.y
```

This ensures **100% accuracy** - coordinates are mathematically derived from actual polygon boundaries, not manually entered or estimated.

### Data Source Lineage
