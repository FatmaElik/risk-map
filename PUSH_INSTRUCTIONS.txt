INSTRUCTIONS TO PUSH & DEPLOY
===============================================

Your new dashboard is ready! Follow these steps:

STEP 1: PUSH TO GITHUB
-----------------------

Choose ONE of these methods:

A) If you have GitHub credentials set up:
   git push origin main

B) If you need to authenticate:
   # Generate a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   # Then run:
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/FatmaElik/risk-map.git main

C) Using GitHub Desktop:
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - It should show your commits (20209f1, 9c57525)
   - Click "Push origin"


STEP 2: VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOYS
----------------------------

If your Vercel project is connected to GitHub:
- Vercel will automatically detect the push
- It will build and deploy within 1-2 minutes
- Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard


STEP 3: ALTERNATIVE - DEPLOY MANUALLY
--------------------------------------

If auto-deploy doesn't work:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project (risk-map)
3. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
4. Select latest commit (9c57525)
5. Click "Redeploy"


STEP 4: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
--------------------------
