## 🐛 Known Issues (None Expected)

All major issues have been fixed:
- ✅ Wrong coordinates → FIXED
- ✅ Population not coloring → FIXED
- ✅ Building count not coloring → FIXED
- ✅ Missing scenarios → ADDED
- ✅ Missing 1 neighborhood (955→956) → FIXED

## 📊 Quick Data Validation

Run this to verify data quality:
```bash
cd /home/fatma/project/MAHALLE_KONTROL/istanbul/risk-map
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import json
with open('public/data/istanbul_mahalle_risk.geojson') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    
features = len(data['features'])
unique_ids = len(set(f['properties']['mah_id'] for f in data['features']))
has_coords = all('X' in f['properties'] and 'Y' in f['properties'] for f in data['features'])
has_scenarios = all('pga_scenario_mw72' in f['properties'] for f in data['features'])

print(f"✅ Features: {features}")
print(f"✅ Unique IDs: {unique_ids}")
print(f"✅ All have coords: {has_coords}")
print(f"✅ All have scenarios: {has_scenarios}")
print(f"\n{'PASS' if features == 956 and unique_ids == 956 else 'FAIL'}")
PYEOF
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Features: 956
✅ Unique IDs: 956
✅ All have coords: True
✅ All have scenarios: True

PASS
```

## 🚀 Deployment

When ready to deploy:
```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

This will:
